# 3D Shirt Customization Tool

Welcome to the 3D Shirt Customization Tool project! This repository is dedicated to creating an interactive tool for customizing 3D shirts. Through this project, I have:

- Learned the fundamentals of Three.js for 3D graphics rendering.
- Mastered React Three Fiber for integrating Three.js with React.
- Explored React Three Drei for enhancing Three.js functionality in React applications.
- Implemented smooth animations using Framer Motion.

## Key Concepts Learned

### Three.js

- **Rendering**: Understanding how to render 3D scenes, manage cameras, and manipulate meshes.
- **Lighting and Materials**: Applying different lighting techniques and materials to create realistic 3D objects.
- **Scene Management**: Organizing scenes, objects, and textures efficiently for optimal performance.

### React Three Fiber

- **Declarative 3D**: Using React components to create and manage 3D scenes with ease.
- **Integration**: Seamless integration of Three.js capabilities into React applications.
- **Component Library**: Leveraging pre-built components from React Three Drei for rapid development.

### Framer Motion

- **Animation**: Creating fluid animations to enhance user interactions and visual appeal.
- **Motion Controls**: Implementing gesture-based controls and transitions for a smoother user experience.
- **Component Animation**: Animating React components seamlessly with Framer Motion.

Thank you for exploring the 3D Shirt Customization Tool project! This project has provided me with valuable insights into combining 3D graphics with web technologies, preparing me to create dynamic and interactive applications.
